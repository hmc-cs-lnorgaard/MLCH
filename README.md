## Summary 
The Shakespeare Script Editor is a website made by team Pawgrammers for CS121: Software Development in the Fall 2017 semester progressing upon work done by team MLCH completed in the Spring 2017 semester. Our web app provides a simple and easy way for directors and actors to
edit scripts and read plays. On the website, a user can choose between any of Shakespeare’s plays. Chosen plays are not only readable, but editable! Users can cut down the play word-by-word. After editing the play to their specifications, the website will provide relevant data and statistics too, such as the number of lines in the play and the number of lines for each individual character in a particular play.

### Problem description
Often when planning a play or preparing for a performance, directors and
actors alike tend to cut out sections from the original script to make it shorter
or get rid of unnecessary lines. Currently two methods exist for this task,
and both have limitations. Directors and actors can either cross out sections
by hand and ignore them, which is tedious and makes the plays harder to
read and interact with, or they can use a generic text editor like Google Docs,
but this provides so much freedom that the original content of the script
can be easily manipulated or lost (as in the case where someone adds lines
that didn’t previously exist to the script). A dedicated script viewer and
editor that primarily only allows cutting and restoring lines would address
both of these issues. It would allow for easier cutting and viewing without
allowing the play to be lost in edits, while also being able to provide data
analysis, like the number of lines per play and which characters are in it, on
the works themselves.

### Stakeholders
Stakeholders for this project include:
* Professors BenWiedermann and Ambereen Dadabhoy – Clients whose
desire for this project is to provide an easier platform to edit Shakespeare
plays. Currently our clients use generic text editors and they
are frustrated by their limited functionality that create difficulty in
editing plays.
* Student collaborators – Users who eventually will be able to suggest
edits to plays along with viewing them.
* Student performers – Users who have read only access to plays
* Directors – Users who are able to edit plays as well as accept or decline
edits suggested by student collaborators. While these are similar to
the clients, our clients explicitly expressed a desire for this application
to be flexible for use outside of their class for generic directors.



## Architecture

### Prerequisites
You must have Ruby on Rails and git on your machine, and clone the repository onto your computer from https://github.com/hmc-cs-lnorgaard/MLCH.git


### Gems 
1.Nokogiri - this gem is used to parse XML files into HTML files.

### Minimum Viable Product
Our MVP is built off of one of the codebases provided from previous
semesters. We used their webpage layout and the parser they worked
on to put the plays on the site. Forking it provided some of the functionality desired in our MVP,
namely choosing a play from those available, reading said play, navigating
through the play’s acts, and searching text within the chosen play using the
browser’s search functionality. On top of these pre-provided functions our
MVP included the ability to cut out words of the play by highlighting
them, and then saving these edits.

### Architecture Model

#### High Level Design 
Our architecture at large has three categories: preprocessing steps, serverside
architecture, and client-side UI. Figure 1 below presents a component
diagram that outlines these three categories. Preprocessing involves downloading
XML files of Shakespeare plays from Folger’s Online Library, which
will then be parsed to HTML files by the Nokogiri gem. These original play
HTML files will be stored on the server. The user starts on the play index,
and upon choosing a play, the original play HTML file will be displayed,
formatted by scss. The user will then be able to cut text from the play, which
will be handled by JavaScript functions. When finished JavaScript will be
used to save the edited version of the play, which will be loaded from then on.
The user can also view analytics calculated by other JavaScript functions.
The decisions and reasoning for using this architecture is presented later in
this document.

The previous group’s work had scaffolding set up for a user role, a
constant play role that models the original, unedited work as gathered
from the Folger’s database, and an edited play role that holds the cuts and
changes performed by a user; however, the user role was left incomplete
and the play and edited play roles were never actually separated. We intend
to finish these roles so that they fit the UML class diagram in Figure 2.

#### Software Design Pattern
We will use the Model-View-Controller software design pattern as it is
heavily supported by the Ruby on Rails framework and has proven to work
well with the web applications we have developed previously.


## Installation

Note: After any command saying "Type `x`", press `enter` before going on to the next command

Step 1: Installing/Updating Ruby
Note: If you know you have the correct version of Ruby (2.4.1), skip this part
1. Open terminal on your computer
2. Type `\curl -sSL https://get.rvm.io | bash -s stable`
3. Type `rvm install ruby-2.4.1`
4. Follow installation prompt (Note: usually just requires pressing `enter` a few times and entering password)
5. Close your terminal to restart it

Step 2: Installing Script Editor
1. Open terminal on your computer
2. (Optional) Navigate to where you would like the program to be on your computer
3. Type `git clone https://github.com/Pawgrammers/Shakespeare-Script-Editor.git`
(Note: if you need to install git, a popup will occur. Follow it and retry the last step. If no popup occurs, continue following steps here)
4. Type `cd Shakespeare-Script-Editor/script_editor/`
5. Type `gem install bundler`
6. Type `bundle install`
7. Wait for gems to install
8. Type `rake db:migrate`
9. Type `cd app/controllers/`
10. (Optional)type `ruby create_scripts.rb “all”` (Note: this will preprocess all scripts on the website. It takes about 15 minutes but will make the site run considerably faster)
11. Wait for scripts to be created
12. To start the application type `rails s` and go to `localhost:3000` in your internet browser of choice
13. To end the application, press `control + c` in your terminal and close the terminal

Step 3: Starting the app after installation
1. Open terminal on your computer
2. Navigate to where the program was installed
3. Type `cd Shakespeare-Script-Editor/script_editor/`
4. Type `rails s`
5. Open your internet browser and go to `localhost:3000`
6. To end the application, press `control + c` in your terminal and close the terminal

## Functionality
TODO -- Copy the final report's functionality section here

This section outlines the total functionality of the app. 
1. Viewing: The user will be able to see any Shakespeare play in readable,
aesthetically-pleasing format. This has already been implemented.
2. Navigation: The user will be able to navigate to any place in the script
using a navigation bar on one side of the screen.

3. Strikethrough: The user can cut through words and lines that they
would like to remove from the play using highlighting or clicking on a speaker's name.

![Cutting functionality](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/21372792/33815748-b6737c72-dde8-11e7-80de-bbca75f0c62d.gif)

4. Saving: The current state of the play can be saved by clicking the save button in the sidebar. From then on, when the play loads, the most recently saved version will be shown.
5. Printing: The user van print their full, edited version of the
play, with or without edits depending on the current toggle view mode.
6. Analytics: The site calculates and displays information about each
play, namely the original line number of each character, how many have been deleted, and lines remaining, shown below.

7. Full and Concise Versions: The user has the option of viewing
either the full original version of the play, having cuts distinct but
visible, and the concise version where cuts are removed to see context
when necessary, shown below.

### Use Case 
TODO 
Figure 3 below outlines the use case of each page of the site.

![Use Case Diagram](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/21372792/33819054-2f368abe-ddfd-11e7-8862-918c87ab6d21.png)

## Known Problems 
If you cut out an entire speech by highlighting, the speaker's name will not automatically be cut out, and vice versa.
